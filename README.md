## üêâ OFDR Patcher

OFDR Patcher is a simple tool to patch **[Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Flashpoint:_Dragon_Rising)**, a realistic, tactical mil-sim shooter game released by [Codemasters](https://www.codemasters.com) in 2009. The game was initially released as version 1.00, until v1.01 was released and later v1.02. However, by default the game comes with several screen resolutions locked (including 4K), a VRAM bug, and on v1.02 mod support was disabled. This patcher fixes these issues by upgrading the game executable to patched v1.02.
