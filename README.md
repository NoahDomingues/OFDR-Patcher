## üêâ OFDR Patcher

OFDR Patcher is a simple tool to patch **[Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Flashpoint:_Dragon_Rising)**, a realistic, tactical mil-sim shooter game released by [Codemasters](https://www.codemasters.com) in 2009. The game was initially released as version 1.00, until v1.01 was released and later v1.02. However, by default the game comes with several screen resolutions locked (including 4K), a VRAM bug, and on v1.02 mod support was disabled. This patcher fixes these issues by upgrading the game executable to patched v1.02.

## üì• Installation

**OFDR Patcher** is a portable application‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need a formal installer. Just grab the latest build from our **[Releases](https://github.com/NoahDomingues/OFDR-Patcher/releases)** section, unzip the archive, and run the downloaded file:

- To patch your game, run OFDR Patcher and click the "Patch OFDR" button to automatically search for the game installation directory. If the game installation directory cannot be auto-detected, it then asks you to open the location manually. Then, it will patch your game.
- To unpatch, run OFDR Patcher and click the "Unpatch OFDR" button to automatically search for the game installation directory. If the game installation directory cannot be auto-detected, it then asks you to open the location manually. Then, it will unpatch your game.
- Use the folder icons next to the patch and unpatch buttons to skip auto-detecting the game install location and open the location manually.
- The "i" info button in the top-right corner opens a small window with some basic information about the patch and software.
- The progress bar and log box in the center of the window display progress updates when patching or unpatching.
